# Varun's Deep Learning Foundations Projects #

This is a repository of projects that I completed as part of Udacity's [Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101) course. The course is a great introduction to the rapidly-evolving field of modern AI, and in particular to deep learning fundamentals and several important types of neural networks.

## Overview of Projects ##

### Bikeshare Rental Prediction ###

Develop a standard Feed-forward Neural Network and train it on historical bike-sharing data to predict daily bike rental volume.
