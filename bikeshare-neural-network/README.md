# Bikeshare Rental Prediction #

## Overview ##

This introductory project entailed developing a feed-forward neural network and training it on historical bike-sharing data to predict daily bike rental volume. I implemented the activation function, the forward pass through the network, and the backpropagation algorithm within the provided framework. As part of training the network, I experimented with and finalized various hyperparameters, such as the learning rate, number of hidden units, and number of training passes.

## Prerequisites & Notes ##

1. Create a new Conda environment for Python 3, or activate an existing environment if desired.
2. The following packages need to be present or installed in your Conda environment -- numpy, matplotlib, pandas, and jupyter notebook
3. As a reference, I've saved a copy of my environment in bikeshare_conda_env.txt.
